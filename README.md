# Line Chart App

I created this chart using svg elements, the chart is scalable and can be filtered. I've also included a add route function so you can play around with it. :) 

There's also a variable file, if you want to change up the UI colors

## How to start 

Install dependencies

### `npm i`

The app will automatically open up a window at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if you run this command.

### `npm start`

I really had fun creating this app and have a few idea's how to extend, but for now I hope this gives you a bit of an idea of my coding style.
